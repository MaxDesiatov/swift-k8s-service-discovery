## Currently open issues

If you want to get involved and improve this project, take a look at the list of open issues- this isn't a big library and most items are reasonably small in scope.

## Before you start

Before starting work on something you want to merge upstream, it's worth double-checking you're not duplicating somebody else's effort, either:

1) By creating a feature request issue
2) By dropping a message on our [Gittr](https://gitter.im/tuplestream/oss?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) channel

## Basic requirements

This is yet to be formalised, but use common sense:

* Have sensible commit messages
* Make sure the CI tests pass
* Make sure any new functionality is tested (remember to run `swift test --generate-linuxmain` to get new tests running in CI builds)
